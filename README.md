# üå± SustAIn ‚Äî Sustainable AI Usage Metrics

**A Chrome extension and reusable React component library that provides real-time sustainability metrics while using websites powered by generative AI.**

> üåç **"As the world races toward AI integration, the invisible environmental cost of generative AI remains overlooked."**  
> This project was born out of the urgent need to make sustainability transparent‚Äîempowering users and developers to understand, measure, and reduce their carbon footprint while using AI tools.  
> By revealing the environmental metrics behind every query, we are not just building technology‚Äîwe are fostering responsible innovation. ‚ö°


## üöÄ Overview

SustAIn is designed to make users aware of the **carbon footprint** and **power efficiency** involved in using AI-powered tools online. It works in real time, processing queries through a lightweight classification model hosted on GCP, and computes sustainability metrics using geo and time-based data.

The project includes:

- A **Chrome Extension** that overlays sustainability insights while users interact with AI services.
- A **React Component Library** (built with TypeScript) that can be integrated into other platforms for sustainability tracking.


## ‚ú® Features

- üåç Real-time estimation of carbon emissions using the Electricity Maps API.
- üìç Geolocation-based datacenter identification via IP-API.
- ‚è∞ PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) computation using timezone data (TimeAPI).
- üß† Custom AI query classification model built with AutoML and deployed on GCP Vertex AI.
- üîå Lightweight, no-Large Language Model (LLM) dependency ‚Äî we train our own small ML model to reduce compute & emissions.
- üß© Chrome extension to monitor sustainability directly in the browser.
- üì¶ Reusable and type-safe React components (published to npm).


## üåç Impact & Use Cases

- Encourages environmentally-conscious AI usage.
- Helps organizations measure their AI-driven digital sustainability.
- Serves researchers looking to evaluate energy efficiency of AI services.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

To maximize the reach and impact of our sustainability insights, we plan to extend the solution through the following future enhancements:

- üì± **Mobile-Centric Integration with Conversational AI Platforms**  
  Extend sustainability insights to mobile environments by integrating with AI-powered mobile applications like ChatGPT and Google Assistant‚Äîempowering users with real-time environmental impact feedback during AI interactions on their smartphones.

- üåê **Cross-Platform Support for Generative AI Services**  
  Extend compatibility beyond the browser to include popular generative AI platforms and tools, ensuring sustainability insights are accessible regardless of where users engage with AI.

- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Deep Integration with Cloud Infrastructure Providers**  
  Collaborate with major cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) to provide deployment engineers with granular, region-specific sustainability analytics for model training and inference workloads.

These future directions aim to embed sustainability awareness natively into AI usage workflows‚Äîempowering both end-users and technical teams to make environmentally responsible choices.
